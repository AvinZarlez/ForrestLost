ForrestLost
===========

"Forrest Lost" - a Sifteo Cube game prototype.

Created in 48 hours as part of the iamagamer 48 hour game jam in Mountain View, California.


Story:
A young girl named Maya is trying to find her lost brother Forrest. She hears him call for help somewhere in the nearby maze like forest of BizSpark Hills, and decides to go after him.


Gameplay:
You can look around the forest by placing Sifteo cubes next to each other, and tapping the cubes to move around. You kind of have to juggle the cubes around to move, which is an interesting tactile sense of fun. I was inspired by seeing in Sandwich Kingdom, one of the games that comes with Sifteo cubes.

I wanted to do a different take on that mechanic, so instead of an adventure game where you walked around, I decided to make a simple game where you were looking for randomly generated clues trying to find where your brother went. I never worked on Sifteo Cubes before, and I spent the first 24 hours just reading through documentation and going through sample code. I didn't want to do a project that was too large in scope to be able to finish, so I went with the classic "Hunt the Wumpus" formula. Forrest calls for help as you move around, and the size of the text tells you how close to him you are getting.

That's all that I was able to implement in the time that I had. Which I think was a success considering that I was co-running the jam so I was quite distracted sometimes, and most of what I was doing was learning how Sifteo works rather than actually creating game code or implementing mechanics.


Future of the game:
I really like the physicality of the Sifteo Cubes. I want to develop with them more, but currently it's not really feasible for me to invest the time/money to do so. 

So I figured I would upload my code to github and make it avaible to others if anyone is interested in looking at it. Most of it is hacked together stuff based on the example projects that come with the Sifteo documentation, so I am not sure how useful it will be.

I have a lot of ideas of what I will do to continue the game. I want to mess around with different difficulty levels, making the game harder for those who want the challenge. I'd like it if Forrest, the kid, moved around as you're trying to find him. Maybe he would call for help every other move instead of every move. I think that will work out well, especially if I make the cry for help distance larger. I might also make the forest more like a maze with rivers and rocks, so you won't always be able to go all four directions. I also like the idea of adding bushes or other debris to each square that you can clear away, both to show that you have been to that space before, and to reveal footprints to know where Forrest has been. Still have to experiment with different gameplay elements.


I hope you enjoy this prototype. If you have any questions or comments, please email me at Tobiah@PlayPerro.com

Have fun finding Forrest!
